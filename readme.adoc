= Lambda Redirector

This is a AWS Lambda Function which will act as a redirector, taking in requests and redirecting them to the configured domain. Currently the implementation will only redirect you to github domains and automatically add `blob/master` for non-root project paths. This allows you to set up something like `git.hein.dev/go-releaser` to take you to the actual code.

== Why

There are a couple reasons why this might be useful for you. 

1. If you plan on moving your project around but want to be independent of `github` domains and orgs. 
2. Shorten the links you share
3. You like customizing things :smile:

== Setup

To install this you'll need to first install `sam`, if you are on macOS you can do this using `brew`.

```sh
brew tap aws/tap
brew install aws-sam-cli
```

== Install 

If you will export a view parameters that the `make` file will use. These define whcih region to deploy into, what the AWS CloudFormation Stack Name should be and what the S3 Bucket the code should be packaged into.

```sh
# S3 Bucket where the code is packaged
export S3_BUCKET=chrishein-website-assets
export STACK_NAME=hein-dev-git
# Domain you want to act as your proxy
export DOMAIN=git.hein.dev
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# For API Gateway you want to provision your cert in us-east-1 even if your deploy in another region.
export ACM_CERT=arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:XXXXXXXXXXXX:certificate/eddb30e8-6502-46bd-b4e0-2f373c1faa8d
# Code Path represents the Github organization to proxy to
export CODE_PATH=github.com/christopherhein
# Route 53 hosted zone, make sure to include a period at the end.
export HOSTED_ZONE=hein.dev.
export DEFAULT_REPO=" "
```

Then we can deploy the application, creating a CloudFormation stack which provisions and API Gateway and Lambda function to contain the application.

```sh
make build_and_deploy
```
